          <h2>MISSION OVERVIEW</h2>
          <hr class="h2Line">
          <div class="overviewContainer">
            <div class="textContainer">
              <p class="overviewP">The Mars 2020 rover mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program,
                a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The Mars 2020 mission addresses
                high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key questions about the potential
                for life on Mars. The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable
                conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life
                itself. The Mars 2020 rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most
                promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a "cache" on the surface of Mars.
                A future mission could potentially return these samples  to Earth.
                That would help scientists study the samples in laboratories with special room-sized
                equipment that would be too large to take to Mars. The mission also provides opportunities
                to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human
                expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian
                atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing
                techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions
                that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.</p>
              <p class="overviewP2">The mission is timed for a launch opportunity in July 2020 when Earth and Mars are in good
                positions relative to each other for landing on Mars. That is, it takes less power to travel
                to Mars at this time, compared to other times when Earth and Mars are in different positions
                in their orbits. To keep mission costs and risks as low as possible, the Mars 2020 design is
                based on NASA's successful Mars Science Laboratory mission architecture, including its Curiosity
                rover and proven landing system.</p>

              <p class="overviewP3">The mission relies on successfully demonstrated technological innovations,
                 especially for entry, descent, and landing (EDL). Like NASA's Curiosity rover
                 (Mars Science Laboratory mission), the Mars 2020 spacecraft uses a guided entry, descent,
                 and landing system. The Mars 2020 mission landing system includes a parachute, descent
                 vehicle, and an approach called a "skycrane maneuver" for lowering the rover on a tether to
                 the surface during the final seconds prior to landing. This type of landing system provides
                 the ability to land a very large, heavy rover on the surface of Mars in a more precise
                 landing area than was possible before Curiosity's landing.</p>

              <p class="overviewP3">The Mars 2020 rover adds new entry, descent, and landing (EDL) technologies,
                 such as Terrain-Relative Navigation
                 (TRN). Terrain-Relative Navigation allows the rover to detect and to avoid hazardous
                 terrain by diverting around it during its descent through the Martian atmosphere.
                 A microphone allows engineers to analyze entry, descent, and landing. It might also capture
                 sounds of the rover at work, which would provide engineers with clues about the rover's
                 health and operations.</p>

            <div class="textContainer">
              <p class="overviewP4">The Mars 2020 rover design is largely based on the engineering design
                for Mars rover Curiosity. This reliance on a proven system reduces mission costs and risks.
                The rover's long-range mobility system allows it to travel on the surface of Mars over a
                distance of 3 to 12 miles (5 to 20 kilometers). The rover has a new, more capable wheel
                design, among other improvements. For the first time, the rover carries a drill for coring
                samples from Martian rocks and soil. It gathers and stores the cores in tubes on the Martian
                surface, using a strategy called "depot caching." Caching demonstrates a new rover capability
                of gathering, storing, and preserving samples. It could potentially pave the way for future
                missions that could collect the samples and return them to Earth for intensive laboratory
                analysis.</p>
              <p class="overviewP4">The Mars 2020 rover helps prepare for future human exploration of Mars with a technology for
                extracting oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, which is 96 percent carbon dioxide.
                This demonstration of new technology helps mission planners test ways of using Mars'
                natural resources to support human explorers and improve designs for life support,
                transportation, and other important systems for living and working on Mars.</p>
